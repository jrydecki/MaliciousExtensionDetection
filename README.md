# MaliciousExtensionDetection

This Repository is owned and maintained by Jacob Rydecki.

This repository contains all the scripts used in an REU project (2022) at New Mexico Institue of Mining and Technology 
under the mentorship of Dr. Jiztou Tong. Dr. Tong and I have worked on developing a method to detect malicious browser 
extensions by analyzing the static extension source code and using machine learning for classifying browser extensions 
as malicious or non-malicious.
